    <h3>Project Objectives</h3>
    <p align="justify">
    This project is a direct response to a Youtube Viral Video my friend let me watch recently. This video tells a really sad story about an innocent girl, Amanda Todd, who had been a victim of cyber bullying and finally committed suicide under tremendous depression. Sometimes people are doing really cruel things over the internet, giving hateful judgements to each other and bullying arround. Unlike the real world bullying, which will eventually die down as time goes by, the cyber bullyings are somehow existing forever and even rolling bigger so it’s really hard to ignore, making it doesn’t end well as always. I personally have similar real-life experience bullied by a group of my close "friends", got isolated and fell into a severe depression for 3 years. So I know how deep it would hurt when you are struggling extremely hard only to get rid of rumors. When you see a kid stained his own white T-shirt by mistake, don't make fun of them, if you cannot help him clean up then at least let him walk away and hopefully he will find someone loves him to help. We should't laugh at others to gain pathetic satisfactions, shouldn't speak aggressively to make others feel worse, should't watch people losing their hopes while keeping hurting them... And these are the original inspirations for me to start this project.
    The logic is simple but I really hope to convey a positive message to  someone who happens to run my app that:<font color=""> You are much much stronger than you thought you were! </font> Let’s forget about all the past at this moment, no matter it was bitter or sweet, because all the love and eagerness that dwell in our hearts are what we should fight for.
    </p>

    <h3>Design & Significance</h3>
    <p align="justify">
    I call this application the MirrorCo, similar pronounciation with the word “Miracle”. This is designed to ba a web application that without an administration access to conduct the full CRUD operations, which is being said, I decided to leave it to all the users: In the controller once the user has been successfully logged in, there will be a kitten who will talk what all the users taught him to say, but each time there will be only one random record returned to the user. Further, the user will decide whether to do some modifications or deletion to this single record. By doing so, it would be a way for us to review our own words and make changes happen: If we all talk to the kitten with nice and encouraging words, he will return us the same nice and encouraging words, and all of these words will be public-accessible so maybe one day when we are sad, suddenly a random but warm message he says will melt our heart. No admin design can avoid the personal preferrence comes from the admin himself and thus granting full trust to the entire public. Each user will have full CRUD access to his own account, conducting updating or closing operations. The purpose of this design is to resemble a simulation of the real-world cyber environment and to convey the message that we are all the mirror reflections to each other, so please make our own words to be posted beautiful.
